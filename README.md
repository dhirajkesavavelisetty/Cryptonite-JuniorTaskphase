# Cryptonite-JuniorTaskphase
### A learning repository created while working through Cryptonite Junior Taskphase



This is a learning repo focused on building fundamentals in capture the flag challenges and cybersecurity concepts. The tasks involve solving intermediate-level CTF challenges, understanding common vulnerabilities, and documenting learnings through markdown reports.

#### 🧩Task 1: Basics

##### Pwn.college
- Worked through beginner modules on **pwn college**
- Focused on exploitation basics and low-level security concepts taught in the pwn.college curriculum
- [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/dojos)

##### OverTheWire-Bandit
- Brushed through levels 0-33
- Learned Linux commands, file permissions, SSH usage, and scripting concepts
- [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)


#### 🧩Task 2: CTF challenges

##### PicoCTF
- Solved 25 picotCTF challenges across five domains (Reverse engineering, Cryptography, Web exploitation, Binary exploitation, Forensics)
- Involved quite some research and learning along the task.
- [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)

##### Custom Mentor Challenges
- Selected Reverse Engineering and Cryptography as my domains of interest and solved 10 custom challenges curated by the mentors.
- These were challenging as compared to the previous ones and required a high amount of problem-solving and analytical thinking 


#### 🧩Main CTFS

##### CitadelCTF
- Participated in Citadel CTF organized by Cryptonite
- Applied learned concepts in a competitive environment
  
#### NiteCTF
- Participated in Nite CTF, an international CTF played worldwide
- Exposure to real-world difficulty and competition




#### Learnings
- Various approaches to solving CTF challenges
- Improved understanding of common system vulnerabilities
- Importance of documentation for later reference
- Working under time constraints in a competitive environment

#### Skills
- Linux command lines
- CTF solving approaches
- Documentation and GitHub
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
